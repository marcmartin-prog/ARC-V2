<section class="history">
  <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
  <p>ARC is dedicated to searching for new opportunities to show God’s love to the hurting refugees coming into our country. </p>
  <p>We seek to do this by raising awarness and connecting the local church with these hurting people. The goal of this connection is to allow the Church an opportunity to send willing men and women to aid refugees in their daily struggles. This involves teaching English classes, Shopping trips, and other acctivities for assimilating to American Culture. </p>
  <p>The end goal is to build lasting relationships with these individuals that God can use for his mighty purpose.</p>
