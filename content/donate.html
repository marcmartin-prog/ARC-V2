      <p>ARC (Anabaptist Refugee Committee) is an Anabaptist organization focused on helping refugees from around the world. Our main focus is to aid refugees entering the United States through resettlement programs. We endeavor to be the hands and feet of Jesus through English classes, helping migrants in need at the Texas/Mexico Border, and assisting churches interested in sponsoring refugee families.</p>
