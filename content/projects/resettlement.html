      <h2>UKRAINE RESETTLEMENT</h2>
      <p>The US government has made it very easy to sponsor refugees from the war in Ukraine. We've helped quite a few churches connect to a family in need and navigate the necessary legal proceedings. </p>
      <p>It's been a real blessing to see churches meet their needs and help them get a new start in a land of peace and safety. While they may not have a path to stay here permanently, our goal is to show them the love of Christ in a time of need.</p>

      <h2>ROHINGYA RESETTLEMENT</h2>
      <p>The Rohingya are an ethnic group that is refugees in Bangladesh. They have no citizenship in any country and are living in refugee camps. At this point, they are nearly completely relying on UN and other organizations, with no real hope for the situation to improve. With the creation of the Welcome Corps, it is now possible for groups of Americans to sponsor these people to give them a chance at a new life.</p>
      <p>This is a much more lengthy process that can take a few years to get approval, but is a very real need. </p>

      <h2>SOUTHERN BORDER RESETTLEMENT</h2>
      <p>Most people that come thru the southern border already have family or a sponsor here in the USA. However for some, that falls thru. For far too many, this leaves them dependent on a life of drugs, prostitution, and other crimes, just to stay alive. Our goal is to give the church a chance to meet their needs, so they can instead find the support they need to be a beneficial member of society.</p>
      <p>We are looking for churches to prepare for this, so that when a family comes thru the border and needs a place to go, that we'd have a list of churches that are ready to receive them. </p>
