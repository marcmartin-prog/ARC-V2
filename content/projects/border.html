      <h2>WORK AT THE TEXAS BORDER"</h2>
      <p>By positioning themselves right outside the border facility, the Texas team has direct access to the migrants coming thru processing. Some migrants already have contacts here in the states, but others are without destination or friends. </p>
      <p>The team uses this short window of opportunity ot offer physical and spiritual help. They offer migrants water, snacks, and a WIFI connection to contact family. The connections built here allow for follow up and eventual resettlement opportunities.</p>
