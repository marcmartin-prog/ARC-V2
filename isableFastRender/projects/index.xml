      <description>MINNEAPOLIS PROJECT The Tea House
FROM THE &#34;TEA HOUSE&#34; Our team consists of houseparents and young single men and ladies. We’ve rented a house that we call the “Tea House”. This is where the young men teach their men’s English classes. They teach morning and afternoon classes 5 days a week, and have an evening class a couple evenings a week. The young ladies have a bit different schedule. They travel to the apartments of the students and have English classes with the ladies and children.</description>
