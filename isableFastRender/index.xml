      <description>THE ARC VISION OUR VISION ARC is dedicated to searching for new opportunities to show God’s love to the hurting refugees coming into our country. We seek to do this by raising awarness and connecting the local church with these hurting people. The goal of this connection is to allow the Church an opportunity to send willing men and women to aid refugees in their daily struggles. This involves teaching English classes, shopping trips, and other activities for assimilating to American Culture.</description>

      <description>OUR HISTORY A BRIEF OVERVIEW ARC ministry was born out of a burden for the Afghan people being housed on the Fort McCoy military base (Pictured Above) in WI. A group of men from various Anabaptist Churches were able to spend some time at the fort and witnessed first-hand the need for a Christian presence among these hurting people. Through this interaction, ARC Ministry was formed and the first volunteers began arriving in November of 2021.</description>

      <description>MINNEAPOLIS PROJECT The Tea House
FROM THE &#34;TEA HOUSE&#34; Our team consists of houseparents and young single men and ladies. We’ve rented a house that we call the “Tea House”. This is where the young men teach their men’s English classes. They teach morning and afternoon classes 5 days a week, and have an evening class a couple evenings a week. The young ladies have a bit different schedule. They travel to the apartments of the students and have English classes with the ladies and children.</description>
